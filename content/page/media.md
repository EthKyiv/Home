ETH:KYIV is Ukraineâ€™s premier community-driven Ethereum event and aims further to establish Kyiv as a leader in infrastructure development. This has never been more necessary than at present; both in our country and with our neighbours, there is a great need for access to infrastructure, recovery, and support systems. 

For this reason, our inaugural event will be focused on localizing global resources to regions and communities that need them, as well as gathering efforts and energy to support Kyiv becoming a hub of innovation.
