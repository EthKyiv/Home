ETH:KYIV is Ukraineâ€™s premier community-driven Ethereum event and aims further to establish Kyiv as a leader in infrastructure development. This has never been more necessary than at present; both in our country and with our neighbours, there is a great need for access to infrastructure, recovery, and support systems. 

For this reason, our inaugural event will be focused on localizing global resources to regions and communities that need them, as well as gathering efforts and energy to support Kyiv becoming a hub of innovation.

## Where We've Begun

**DayZero** Through this, we hope that the city and those connected to it will be able to foster a growing impact on furthering the transparency and democratic governance of resource allocation and access to public goods. Through these efforts, partnerships, and the companies that grow out of them, we aim to ensure Kyiv will continue to grow to be a leader of modern development and a resource for communities ready to rebuild. 

It is with these interests that the public goods portion of the hackathon will begin early so that the benefits of these innovations can impact the people of Ukraine sooner, and the conference can then become an opportunity to expand that impact even further.
ETH:KYIV is no mere event; it is an innovation festival, celebrating and supporting those at the forefront of it, and it promises to be jam-packed days of informative presentations, panel discussions,
