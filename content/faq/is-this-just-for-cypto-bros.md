This is for those interested in the future of industry, and the futures for innovation that live in web3. Our conversations will come largely from the forefront of Ethereum and associated blockchain technologies, but innovation doesnâ€™t stop at Web3. Traditional business is perhaps the most benefited from such advancements and cultures of development. And this event aims to ensure Ukraine will continue to be a leader on this front:

* In 2020, Ukraine was ranked 43rd in the world for innovation by the Global Innovation Index. We plan to bring it into the top 20 by 2025.
* According to a report by PwC, the Ukrainian IT industry generated over $5 billion in revenue in 2020. Our Crypto industry alone is on track to beat these numbers in 2023
* The Ukrainian government has allocated over $220 million to develop innovation and technology parks in the country. We are in talks to double this by 2024
* Remote work is booming in Ukraine. The number has increased by over 100k in the last year alone, according to a survey by Ernst & Young, and is increasing daily.
